## Project Overview
This repository contains a predictive model for forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI). Leveraging historical data and various environmental factors, the model aims to provide accurate predictions of air quality. This tool is especially useful for environmental analysis and public health forecasting. Here is our overview presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12qIVOqvXwf3i6aiDVw8Bp3tbGJooAP3fUF4febfIwdw/edit?usp=sharing

## Data Sources
The model uses several datasets that include historical records of AQI, Ozone concentration, PM2.5 levels, and comprehensive weather features. The data is structured to highlight the temporal relationship with AQI values over a span of multiple years.

## Key Variables
The model incorporates a wide range of variables to predict AQI:

Date: To capture temporal trends.

Previous AQI: To understand the continuity in air quality trends.

Ozone Concentration & PM2.5: Critical pollutants affecting air quality.

Weather Features: Including temperature (Max/Min/Mean), dew point, humidity, sea level pressure, visibility, wind speed, precipitation, and cloud cover.

## Modeling Approach
Time Series Model Forecasting Long Short-Term Memory
trained on data from the 1980s and tested on data from the 1990s.
This model combines the traditional time series analysis with advanced LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)/
A Time Series Model is used to analyze and predict time-ordered data points.
For example, an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) can be used in this instance.
An LSTM is a recurrent neural network, meaning that it can handle sequences of data.
Its memory capability allows it to remember and utilize past information effectively, which is crucial in predicting future AQI values.


## Model Validation
The model's predictions are compared against actual AQI values from past events to gauge its accuracy.
This approach enables an understanding of the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios and its potential applicability for future predictions.
